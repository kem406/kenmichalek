This is my final project for MATH E-23C, a course at the Harvard Extension School. It is a "bot" that takes in a dataset in the form of a .csv file and performs various analyses on the data, such as distribution fitting and permutation tests. You can read more [here](https://kem406.github.io/MATH-E23C/) (WIP).
