This was my final project for MATH E-23C, a course at the Harvard Extension School. It was my attempt at artificial intelligence that could handle basic data science tasks, in the form of a compact R function that could take in a dataset. The dataset I used for this project was the forestfires.csv set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which I gave to the math23c_bot() function in order to predict where forest fires are most likely to occur in a 9x9 grid of the Montesinho Natural Park in Portugal.
