This is a robotic arm I built for PHYS S-12 (Intro to Digital Fabrication) at the Harvard Summer School. You can read more [here](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/12/).

I am also continuing to update the robot. For example, I am designing a new circuit board for the robot's controls as my final project for ENSC E-123 (Digital Circuit Design), which you can read about [here](https://kem406.github.io/ENSC-E123/).
