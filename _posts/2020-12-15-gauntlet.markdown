This robot was envisioned by Si Chiang Wu as a helpful tool during the COVID-19 pandemic, and served as my team's (Francisco Marquez, Si Chiang, and myself) final project for ENG-SCI 51: Computer-Aided Machine Design. The idea behind the robot is that it would extend a hook-like tool used to open and close doors so the user does not have to contact the door handle with their bare fingers. I came up with the idea that the end tool would utilize a mechanism that allows the wearer to use their fingers to pull a spring-loaded lever that simultaneously rotates the hook into position out of its protective shell and also directly transfers the user's grip strength to the hook tool (so the user is pulling the door open, rather than the robot doing the pulling). Otherwise, the purpose of the robot would be silly; there already exist keychains that accomplish the same thing without a bulky robot strapped to your armâ€”my design gave the robot the newly-defined purpose of placing tools into the user's hand on command.

Theoretically, one could switch out the spring-loaded hook with other end tools. We designed a few that could conceivably serve other purposes (such as a "button pusher"), though none of these proved to be particularly useful.
